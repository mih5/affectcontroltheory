For example, consider vectors whose elements are sampled from a standard normal normal distribution:\n$$\n\\bar{v} = [v_1, v_2 ... v_D]\\\\\nv_i \\sim \\text{iid} N(0,1)\n$$\nwhere D is the length of the vector.  We might expect that the distribution of these vectors in ${\\rm I\\!R}^D$ would look like some sort of ball with most of its mass around the origin, much like how a normal distribution has most of its mass around 0.  This is not the case!\n\nConsider the expected value of the square of the vector magnitudes:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\rm I\\!E} [ ||\\bar{v}||^2] &= {\\rm I\\!E} [v_1^2 + v_2^2 ...v_D^2]\\\\\n&=  {\\rm I\\!E} [v_1^2] + {\\rm I\\!E} [v_2^2] ... {\\rm I\\!E} [v_D^2]\\\\\n&= Var(v_1) + Var(v_2) ... var(v_D)\\\\\n&= 1 + 1 .... \\\\\n&= D\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis indicates that the expected value for the magnitude squared of these vectors is the length of the vector!  Indeed, very few vectors are near the origin; instead, the distribution forms a shell of radius $\\sqrt{D}$ about the mean.\n\nWith a simulation, we confirm our analysis:\n\n```{r message = FALSE}\nrequire(mvtnorm)\nD <- 100\nsamples <- rmvnorm(1000, mean = rep(0, D))\nvectorMagSq <- function(vector){\n  sum(vector^2)\n}\nmagnitudes.squared <- apply(samples, MARGIN = 1, FUN = vectorMagSq)\n```\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\ndata <- data.frame(Magnitudes = magnitudes.squared)\nplot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Magnitudes))\nplot + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = \"white\", color = \"steelblue\", stroke = 2) + xlim(c(0,150)) + xlab(\"Magnitudes Squared\")\n```\n\nHow odd!  This suggests that if we want a distribution with support on ${\\rm I\\!R}^D$ which is concentrated about the origin and is more diffuse as we venture outwards, we should look elsewhere.",
